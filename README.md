Welcome! 😊

This Notebook goes over the basic fundamentals of Machine Learning/Deep Learning using PyTorch.

I am following along freeCodeCamp.org's full course on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_xro1bcAuA

I will section off topics and code in everything as such. There will be some required code blocks to run, but in general, everything basic will be here. I will (hopefully) make projects of my own once I am familiar enough with PyTorch and may even expand my horizons.
